        <p>My name is Fernando Medina, I am originally from Passaic, NJ. I currently live in Lyndhurst, NJ and have been living here for the past year and a half. After high school and some college I was asked to work a couple days on a TV show called <em>Person of Interest</em> it is a show on CBS. I loved working in the film industry and continued that for about 6-7 years. For those that don't know working in film is a lot of hard work and long hours. To get away from such physical work and long hours I decided to take on coding! Joining the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp has been my first step into starting my journey.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Some of my hobbies include longboarding and watching my favorite TV shows with my girlfriend which include Shark Tank, WestWorld, and This is Us. I have a pet tortoise named Shredder aka Lil' Shred aka Bauer (for Jack Bauer). Oh and of course I can't forget my new favorite hobby which is CODING!</p>
